  Video frame call back function definition

  The callback will be called on every frame when running on the supported host.

  We require the frame rate of the video to be at least 22fps for 720p, thus the
  callback should process a frame timely.

  The video app should call `notifyVideoFrameProcessed` to notify a successfully
  processed video frame.

  The video app should call `notifyError` to notify a failure. When the failures
  accumulate to a certain number, the host will see the app is "frozen" and ask
  the user to close it or not.
