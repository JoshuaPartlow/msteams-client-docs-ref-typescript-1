  FrameContexts provides information about the context in which the app is
  running within the host.

  Developers can use FrameContexts to determine how their app should behave in
  different contexts,

  and can use the information provided by the context to adapt the app to the
  user's needs.


  **Example**


  ```ts

  If your app is running in the "settings" context, you should be displaying
  your apps configuration page.

  If the app is running in the content context, the developer may want to
  display information relevant to

  the content the user is currently viewing.
