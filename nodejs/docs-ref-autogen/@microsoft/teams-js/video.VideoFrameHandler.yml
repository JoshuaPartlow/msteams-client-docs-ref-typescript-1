  Video frame call back function definition.

  The callback will be called on every frame when running on the supported host.

  We require the frame rate of the video to be at least 22fps for 720p, thus the
  callback should process a frame timely.

  The video app should resolve the promise to notify a successfully processed
  video frame.

  The video app should reject the promise to notify a failure. When the failures
  accumulate to a certain number, the host will see the app is "frozen" and ask
  the user to close it or not.
