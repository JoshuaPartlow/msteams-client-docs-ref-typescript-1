      Navigates the frame to a new cross-domain URL. The domain of this URL must
      match at least one of the

      valid domains specified in the validDomains block of the manifest;
      otherwise, an exception will be

      thrown. This function needs to be used only when navigating the frame to a
      URL in a different domain

      than the current one in a way that keeps the app informed of the change
      and allows the SDK to

      continue working.
