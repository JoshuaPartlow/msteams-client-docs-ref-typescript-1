summary: >-
  VideoFrame definition, align with the W3C spec:
  https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs/#videoframe-interface.

  The current version of typescript doesn't have the definition of VideoFrame so
  we have to define it here.

  At runtime it can be cast to VideoFrame directly: `(videoFrame as
  VideoFrame)`.
